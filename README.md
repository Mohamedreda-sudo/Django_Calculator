# Django_Calculator
 #To run this app simply clone it into your IDE then type the following commands:
to make sure you are in the right directory type :
#"cd Django_Calculator/Calculator"
#"dir": it should show the multiple files where the django project is.
to run the app simply type :
#"python3 manage.py runserver"
if it shows an error about the python3 not working simply replace python3 with python and it should work just fine :)
